Raspberry Pi Email Notifier 
For our project we decided to make an email notifier using the Raspberry Pi and a sense hat. At first, we tried making a security camera with the Raspberry Pi. When it wasnt working and the deadline was approaching, we decided to try a new project. The email notifier is a fun and colorful way to see when you get a new email. The sense hat lights up and shows the number of unread emails you have.
